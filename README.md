This project required refactoring an existing website to meet accessibility standards and clean up html/css

I focused on the following (though this is not an exhaustive list)

HTML:
-Semantic HTML: renamed all the sections of the site from "div" to better describe what in the site they actually are (ex: header, nav, figure, etc). This should help with screen reader and braille applications as well as search engine optimization.
-Added alt text to all images
-Reduced/eliminated redundant class/id's in various page elements
-Ensured HTML order flowed consistently with the order of the website
-Gave site a title
-Fixed broken/incorrect links
-Used comments to identify and separate page elements

CSS:
-Correct all colors on the site to be the same whites/blues for consistency and ease of reading
-Increased font size of main text to improve readability
-Changed all font from px to % to allow for better scaling to the user's needs
-Added padding and alignment to header, nav, and side bars to better center the content and make text asthetic and easier to read
-Added a high contrast highlight to link button when clicked
-Fixed containers to evenly encapsulate all contents at different window sizes
-Condensed a considerable amount of class css elements to simply fall within their larger section class - this reduced length of css sheet sigificantly without changing functionality
-Ordered CSS sheet to flow with page contents
-Used comments to divide up and describe CSS sheet
